# A New <strike>Hope</strike> Beginning

Here begins the documenting of my attempts at both staying current and relevant in the rapidly changing world of operations. Devops is the new thing.  I am a bit of an old guard BOFH, even if I never quite bought into the BOFH attitude.

## Blarggy Blahg

This blog runs on [octopress][1] (itself a 'framework' running atop [jekyll][2]), pretty much bog standard.  I like that I'm using my current fav text editor ([Sublime Text][3]) rather than a web based text entry window.

Things I'm hoping to gain by this:

- comfort with writing in markdown
- more interaction with ruby
- noodling for the sake of noodling.

## Devops?

So, yeah, this devops thing.  It's interesting, I'm excited by it, and challenged to step up my scripting/coding chops.

Also, I'm trying to move a very old school dev vs ops culture to more of a devops style place.  I'll be documenting that attmept here too.

## Whut?

nothing.
