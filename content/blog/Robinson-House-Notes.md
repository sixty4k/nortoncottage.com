# Robinson House Notes

Thank you for watching our house and cats!  Make yourself at home, any food in the fridge or pantry is up for grabs.

## Cats

Meet our team:
* Patty - long hair, tortoise shell, grumpy little love. Nervous purring.
* Meatball - The Old Man, orange.  Patient.  Quietest purr ever.
* Mimzy - The bigger of the calico pair, with the weird tail.  She might have missed some cat classes.  Love bites are hard. 
* Lark - Littlest, but still the boss.  May be shy at first, especially of bigger men.

Meatball and Mimzy are our escape artists, they will try and zip out the door as you come in, be prepared to block (step into the opening right away, give em a firm 'No cats outside!').  If a cat gets out, they will generally move fast _to_ the door and then slow once outside, not too hard to scoop them up and bring them back inside.  

### feeding

#### wet food

Breakfast around 7am
Dinner around 6pm
A little earlier or later is okay, do what works for you.  The cats will appreciate consistency and learn quickly what your schedule is.

(Remember to do Patty's pill!)

1 can of wet food split evenly across the 4 cats.

Every 3 to 4 days rinse the cat food bowls. The cats appreciate it.

#### Dry food

If the dry food bowl in the window sill is empty, scoop from the automatic filler hopper.
When the hopper is low, top it off with dry food from bag.
Once a bag is open, don't leave it out where the cats can get to it.  (Pantry, make sure door latches)

Patty will beg, it's okay to give her a few kibbles when you fill the windowsill bowl.

### Medicine for Patty

Patty (Long hair!) needs 1/2 pill at breakfast and dinner.  (Pills are already split, in blue pill bottle on Kitchen island)
When you gather the food bowls for wet foods, the cats will all come running.
Before feeding the horde, take a 1/2 pill, put it into a pill pocket (Greenies bag on island) and seal the pocket.
Shoo the other cats away from Patty and put the pill pocket on the ground in front of her, she'll scarf it immediately.  

### litter Boxes
Located in laundry room, Mike's office, and master bathroom.

Laundry room box gets the most use, least pleasant to skip days on.  If you scoop 1 box every other day and rotate through them, that should be perfect. 

I typically use a paper grocery bag, and that can handle scooping across all three boxes.  If we're out of those, there are plastic grocery bags for days above the laundry room litter box, usually need a bag per box then.

### Cats are Gross Sometimes

Sometimes, more often if we're away, a cat will hork or someone (Patty) will track a poop out of the litter box.  Keep an eye out cause no one likes to step in it.  Mostly easy to grab a paper towel and scoop it up.  

## Trash

Trash and Recycle bins are in garage near the outer door.  Recycle is only paper & plastics.

Just inside the garage door is a bin for recycling so you don't have to go all the way through the garage. 

We collect glass in boxes by the inner garage door, those get taken when they're full, don't worry about dealing with.

### Pickup Schedule 

Trash pickup is on Thursdays, roll out bin on Wednesday night.
Recycling is on first Thursday of the month.  

### kitchen trash

Fresh bags are on top of the laundry room fridge.
