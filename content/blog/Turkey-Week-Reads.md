# Listicles of recent good reads

I caught up on a bunch of reading in feedly and instapaper on various planes and travels this week:

[TIL: There's a Nobel prize for economics, also behavioral economics exists](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/richard-thaler/)

[A Bump in the Wire](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201808)

[build and test infra seems like it could mix, but probably shouldn't](https://medium.com/@thomas.shaw78/splitting-build-and-test-infrastructure-d10a03f9c1f9)

[just because you can doesn't mean you should](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZombieDistroVersions)

# Work Related
[Find all variables used in a terraform module](https://blog.yo61.com/find-all-variables-used-in-a-terraform-module-2/) -- Could be a useful piece of module linting, maybe tie it in with [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform)

# Considering Hugo for all the blarghs
[Need to create a podcast-friendly RSS feed - support - Hugo Discussion](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/need-to-create-a-podcast-friendly-rss-feed/1727/12) -- While this isn't a podcasting blog, my other [dusty website](https://dollarbinsins.com) was and might be again.
