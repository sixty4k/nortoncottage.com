## A Backlog of saved links.

I need to do some script-y magic to collect these each week or two, but today I'm stuck on a plane without internet but [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) has all my random saved links synced.

[Milk Crates!](https://tedium.co/2019/03/19/milk-crate-theft-history/)
: I love tedium for random deep dive essays on random shouldn't be interesting but totally are subjects.

[On Moving Fast and Breaking Things](https://seths.blog/2019/03/move-fast-and-break-things-isnt-a-worthy-slogan/)
: The focus should be on the doing it well; in the time it takes to do; rather that a self destructive focus on speed over all else.

[Farms arenâ€™t tossing perfectly good produce. You are. - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2019/03/08/feature/farms-arent-tossing-perfectly-good-produce-you-are/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.3072602dde0b)
: On these weird ugly food box services.

[Robert Smith and the perky interviewer](https://www.instagram.com/marycmccormack/p/BvuWHM1lo4K/)
: This made me laugh

[The Momo challenge is a hoax. But the online culture and financial rewards that made it seem feasible are scary.](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/momo-challenge-hoax-online-culture-financial-rewards-made-it-seem-ncna978226?cid=referral_taboolafeed)
: This didn't make me laugh.

[The official fast food French fry power rankings - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-french-fry-rankings-20190212-story.html)
: This dude is not to be trusted, his idea of good is 'so salted that it burns'.
5 guys fries are possibly the worst things in the world, followed only by their burgers.
The fries at In-n-Out on the other hand are fresh, tasty, and hot.
