## A Backlog of saved links.

I need to do some script-y magic to collect these each week or two, but today I'm stuck on a plane without internet but [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) has all my random saved links synced.

- I love tedium for random deep dive essays on random shouldn't be interesting but totally are subjects. [Milk Crates!](https://tedium.co/2019/03/19/milk-crate-theft-history/)

- The focus should be on the doing it well; in the time it takes to do; rather that a self destructive focus on speed over all else. [On Moving Fast and Breaking Things](https://seths.blog/2019/03/move-fast-and-break-things-isnt-a-worthy-slogan/)

- On these weird ugly food box services. [Farms arenâ€™t tossing perfectly good produce. You are. - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2019/03/08/feature/farms-arent-tossing-perfectly-good-produce-you-are/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.3072602dde0b)

- [Robert Smith and the perky interviewer](https://www.instagram.com/marycmccormack/p/BvuWHM1lo4K/)

- This dude is not to be trusted, his idea of good is 'so salted that it burns' [The official fast food French fry power rankings - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-french-fry-rankings-20190212-story.html)  5 guys fries are possibly the worst things in the world, followed only by their burgers.
The fries at In-n-Out on the other hand are fresh, tasty, and hot.
