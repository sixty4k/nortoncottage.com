## Who

A <strike>sysadmin</strike> <strike>ops</strike> devops engineer for money, occasional DJ and record nerd for fun.

## Why

I've been deleting social media accounts, or curtailing my use of them pretty heavily over the last year, and I miss having an outlet, but don't miss the need for validation that came along with those outlets.  I miss writing, but also putting that writing somewhere that people could, in theory, read.  Trying to get into a regular habit of writing longerform thoughts and giving back on the technical know-hows.

## How

I wrote my own blog engine in the long ago and far away, now I'm trying out [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Site is styled with bootstrap and as little web design as I could figure out in a few days during Thanksgiving.
